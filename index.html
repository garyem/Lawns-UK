        <strong>Looking after a lawn in the UK — especially on clay soil — takes a little extra love, but the rewards are well worth it.</strong> Clay holds onto nutrients and moisture better than sandy soils, which means your lawn can thrive with the right care. Regular aeration and seasonal scarifying help relieve compaction, while top-dressing with compost improves structure and encourages deep, healthy roots. For a more sustainable approach, choose organic lawn feeds, compost grass clippings, and water early in the morning to reduce evaporation. By working with the natural properties of clay and embracing eco-friendly methods, you’ll build a greener, more resilient lawn that supports biodiversity — and looks brilliant year-round.
